# Begin Loop Command


## What does this command do?
This command allows you to evaluate a logical statement to determine if the statement is true. The following actions will repeat continuously until that statement becomes false


## When would I want to use this command?
Use this command when you want to check if a statement is 'true' or 'false' and subsequently loop actions based on either condition. Any 'BeginLoop' command must have a following 'EndLoop' command.
